  I’m a passionate Frontend Developer who loves creating clean, responsive, and engaging user interfaces.  
  I enjoy working with technologies like <strong>React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</strong>, and exploring new ways 
  to make web experiences smoother and more interactive.  

  Lately, I’ve been diving into the fascinating world of <strong>blockchain technology</strong> — learning how 
  decentralized systems can transform the way we share and secure data. I’m also studying <strong>Japanese</strong> 
   and love challenging myself to learn new things every day.  

  Outside of tech, I’m a huge fan of <strong>gaming</strong> — it inspires me to think creatively, pay attention 
  to design details, and build experiences that truly connect with users. My goal is to keep growing as a developer 
  and work on projects that combine creativity, logic, and real-world impact.
